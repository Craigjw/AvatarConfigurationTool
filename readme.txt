Avatar Configuration Tool

The Avatar Configuration Tool is a Unity Editor tool to aid configuration of Humanoid Character
Avatars, in particular for use when retargeting characters. It provides functionality to view, save, load,
Undo and Redo character poses, so that we can configure the avatar without fear of losing previous
edits to the pose.

The Avatar Configuration Tool only supports Humanoid Characters and will not work with Generic
Characters in any way.
